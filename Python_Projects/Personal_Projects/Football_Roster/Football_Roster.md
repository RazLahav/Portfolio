Football Roster
"Football Roster" is my first Python project, focusing on the use of lists rather than dictionaries to allocate players into three balanced teams based on their ratings and positions. The code provides a flexible user experience, allowing input through full names, first names, or even selecting from a stored player library while also supporting guest player entries. It includes UI functionality that enhances user interaction and ensures smooth operation, even handling mistakes.
This project showcases my growing programming skills, emphasizing structured data handling, user-friendly design, and practical applications in sports team management.

Enjoy !
